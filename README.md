In order to sun this code, the following commands must be written in the terminal:

python app.py
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8888/productionplan?filename=payload1.json"

On curl, you must put the name of the json file you want to upload. I have included payload1.json, which was given in the statement. In order to use the file, it must be in the same folder.
